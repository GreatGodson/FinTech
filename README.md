# FinTech (WIP)

This project uses transactions in Firebase(FirebaseAuth and FireStore) to send and receive virtual money across accounts.
On account creation, a user has $500 worth of money across 3 wallets, in different currencies(NGN,USD,GBP).
A user can make conversions from one currency to another currency across the three wallets depending on a user's wallet balance.
